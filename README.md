# Summary
This is an extremely baseline setup of `nvim` to provide necessary IDE tooling.

I've tried only to include the most official libraries, and completely avoided using a package manager.

# Setup
If cloning the repo, plugins can be downloaded automatically using:
`git clone --recurse-submodules -b minimal https://github.com/quesuerte/nvim.git`

Otherwise, if the repo is already downloaded, use:
`git submodule update --init --recursive --remote`
